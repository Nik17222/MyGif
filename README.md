# MyGif

There are 4 jpg files containing different motion of the bird flying. 
Make sure the images and the code file are in same directory.
The 'create_gif.py' code file is to make it visible as moving/flying. 
The 'bird.gif' contains the final gif result.
For adding other images of your own make sure the images are of same sizes and image format.
